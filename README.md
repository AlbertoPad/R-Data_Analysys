# R Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the R Data Analysis Project! This project is a statistical analysis and visualization of data using the R programming language. It makes use of various R packages and libraries to achieve comprehensive data processing and representation.

## Project Description

The main script, `Proyecto_estadistica.Rmd`, contains R code and markup for a statistical data analysis. This script explores, cleans, and analyzes a dataset, presenting the results through visualizations and summary statistics. 

## Getting Started
